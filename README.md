# AI Chat Bot 🤖

A simple AI-powered chat interface built with vanilla JavaScript (or your chosen stack), demonstrating the integration of large language model APIs for natural language interaction.

This project showcases how OpenAI, or can be used to build a real-time conversational interface — a foundation for more advanced AI-assisted workflows.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User types a message in the input box
2. JavaScript sends the message to the AI API endpoint
3. The API response is parsed
4. The chat UI updates with the AI’s answer

This app is intentionally minimal to highlight pure integration logic without frameworks.
